# Decorators

This is a repository containing all the decorators I made

## How to install

1. Download this repository by executing `git clone https://github.com/Louis-Navarro/decorators.git` or by downloading the `.zip` file. Then, open a command prompt in the file.

2. Enter `pip install -e .` in the command prompt and press enter to install the package.

3. Done! You can now use my decorators anywhere using `from decorators import *` or just `import decorators`
